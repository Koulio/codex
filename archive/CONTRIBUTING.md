# Contributing to Codex

When contributing a pull request, be sure to submit your pull request against the [**master**](https://github.com/starkandwayne/codex/tree/master) branch.  See below
for the Pull Request Workflow.

## Pull Request Workflow

Follow these steps to make a contribution:

1. Fork the repository.

1. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my_cool_branch`)

1. Make changes on the branch:
    * Adding content
    * Fixing a typo
    * Revising text

1. Push to your fork (`git push origin my_cool_branch`) and submit a pull request
selecting `master` as the target branch.

We favor pull requests with very small, simple commits with a single purpose.

Your pull request is much more likely to be accepted if:

* Your pull request is small and focused with a clear message that conveys the
intent of your change.
